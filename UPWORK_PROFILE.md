# Upwork Profile

**Title**: AI Systems Engineer - Voice Agents, RAG Systems, Full-Stack AI

---

## Overview

I build production-grade AI systems that actually work in the real world.

My focus is on end-to-end AI agent systems with a particular strength in voice AI. I've built complete voice agents from scratch—handling speech recognition (STT), synthesis (TTS), real-time streaming, and LLM orchestration. My main project [SolarVox](https://github.com/CyberianSun/voice-agent) demonstrates this: a real-time voice agent using Deepgram for speech processing, Daily.co for WebRTC streaming, and Pipecat for pipeline orchestration.

For RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), I work with the full stack of vector databases—pgvector for self-hosted setups, Pinecone and Qdrant for managed services, Milvus for large-scale deployments, and FAISS for fast similarity search. I've built knowledge base systems that can query tens of thousands of documents with semantic search.

I also have experience with Neo4j graph databases, which I combine with vector search for hybrid retrieval systems—useful when you need both semantic similarity and structured relationships in your knowledge base.

On the architecture side, I build with FastAPI for Python backends, React and Next.js for frontends, PostgreSQL (with pgvector), and Supabase when appropriate. I set everything up with Docker and can deploy to your VPS or Coolify.

What I bring is practical AI engineering—not just calling APIs, but building systems that scale, handle edge cases, and run reliably in production.

## Services I Offer

### AI Agent Architecture
Build autonomous agents with multi-agent systems using LangChain and LangGraph. I implement tool calling, function calling, and state management so your agents can actually do things—query databases, call external APIs, and make decisions based on context.

### Voice AI & Conversational Agents
Real-time voice agents using Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Twilio, or Telnyx. I handle the full pipeline: speech recognition, LLM processing, speech synthesis, and WebRTC streaming for low-latency conversations. My experience with Pipecat gives me a production-ready framework for complex voice systems.

### RAG Systems & Vector Search
Knowledge base systems with semantic search. I work with pgvector (self-hosted, privacy-friendly), Pinecone (managed), Qdrant (open-source), and Milvus (large-scale). I'll recommend the right option for your use case and build the entire ingestion, retrieval, and ranking pipeline.

### Full-Stack AI Applications
End-to-end AI products including FastAPI backend, React/Next.js frontend, vector search integration, and production deployment. You get a working system, not just a component.

### Advanced Retrieval (Neo4j + Vector Graphs)
When you need more than simple vector similarity, I build hybrid retrieval systems combining Neo4j knowledge graphs with vector search. This is useful for complex domains where relationships matter—like connecting entities, tracing dependencies, or reasoning across connected data.

## Why Work With Me

I work with the full stack of AI technologies, not just one provider. If you need self-hosted vector search, I can do pgvector. If you want a managed service, I can do Pinecone or Qdrant. If you need a voice agent, I can handle Twilio, Telnyx, Deepgram, or ElevenLabs—plus the WebRTC streaming infrastructure to make it real-time.

I've actually built production systems, not just prototypes. My voice agent project is open-source and you can see the architecture yourself.

The systems I build are designed to run in production—Dockerized, scalable, with proper error handling and monitoring. Not something that breaks when traffic increases.

## Education & Approach

I'm focused on practical AI engineering—building systems that solve real business problems. I keep up with emerging technologies (Pipecat for voice pipelines, hybrid graph-vector retrieval) but only use them when they actually add value.

My approach is to understand what you're trying to achieve, then recommend and implement the right technical solution. No forcing tools that don't fit the use case.

## Availability

I'm available for fixed-price and hourly projects. I prefer clear requirements and deliverables—makes the work smoother for both of us.
