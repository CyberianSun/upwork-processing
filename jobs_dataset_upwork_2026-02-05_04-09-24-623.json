We manage 57+ employer groups with ~1,250 employees and work with 25+ insurance carriers. We also provide white-label back-office services for partner agencies.\n\nWe're at a growth inflection point: our expertise and client relationships are strong, but manual administrative work is capping our scale. We need to change that.\n\nThe Opportunity\nWe're implementing a comprehensive automation strategy to streamline our case onboarding and ongoing service workflows. We've mapped our full operational lifecycle - from initial sale through annual renewal - and identified significant time savings through better integration and automation.\n\nYou'll help us transform from: Manual data entry, platform-hopping, and repetitive administrative tasks\nTo: Automated workflows where data flows between systems and exceptions surface for human attention\n\nTech Stack Overview\nWe'll share specific platform names after initial conversations and NDA, but here's what you'd be working with:\n\nSystem Type\nFunction\nIntegration Priority\nCRM/AMS Platform\nCentral hub - single source of truth\nHIGH - Everything flows here\nBenefits Admin Platforms (3)\nEmployee enrollment & reimbursement\nHIGH - Core operations\nPayment Platform\nBenefits card loading & funding\nHIGH - Automate manual processes\nLead Generation Tool\nAI-powered prospecting\nMEDIUM\nPhone System\nVoIP with call intelligence\nMEDIUM\nACA Enrollment Platform\nMarketplace enrollments\nLOW\n\n\nAll platforms have APIs or integration capabilities. Some are more mature than others.\n\nWorkflow Scope\nWe've documented our full operational lifecycle - from initial prospect through ongoing client service and annual renewal. This includes multiple phases spanning sales, employer setup, employee enrollment, carrier coordination, and ongoing support.\n\nWe'll share detailed workflow documentation after NDA, but you should expect to work across the entire client lifecycle, not just one piece of it.\n\nInitial Project Focus\nWe need an integrated dashboard and workflow automation system that provides visibility across our full client lifecycle:\n\nProspecting & Sales - Lead tracking and pipeline visibility\nNew Business - Signed client onboarding status\nEmployer Setup - Platform configuration and document completion\nEmployee Enrollment - Enrollment progress and carrier submissions\nOngoing Service - Client and employee support tracking\n\nThe goal is a single view that shows where every client and prospect stands, with automated alerts when action is needed and data flowing between systems without manual re-entry.\n\nWhat We're Looking For\nMust-Have Skills:\nExperience with API integrations and middleware (Zapier, Make/Integromat, n8n, or custom)\nAbility to work with CRM/AMS platforms\nComfort with payment system automation and financial data handling\nData transformation skills (reformatting files for different platform requirements)\nStrong problem-solving skills - not all systems have clean APIs\nClear communication - you'll work directly with our small team (2 people)\n\nNice-to-Have:\nInsurance or benefits industry experience\nExperience with employee benefits platforms or HR systems\nPython, JavaScript, or similar for custom scripting when needed\nDatabase/reporting experience for dashboards\n\nMindset:\nPragmatic over perfect - we need working solutions, not elegant architecture\nOwnership mentality - flag problems early, propose solutions\nDocumentation habits - we need to maintain what you build\n\nWorking Arrangement\nCommunication: Regular check-ins (weekly minimum), async updates\nHours: Flexible, estimated 15-25 hrs/week depending on phase\nAccess: Full credentials and access to all systems after NDA\nDecision-making: You'll have latitude to recommend approaches; we make final calls together\nAI Collaboration: We use Claude (AI assistant) as a project partner to help maintain documentation, troubleshoot issues, and keep work aligned with our overall architecture. You'll collaborate with both us and Claude to move efficiently.\n\nHow to Apply\nPlease include:\n\n1. Relevant experience: 2-3 examples of similar integration or automation projects you've completed. Bonus points for insurance/benefits, HR platforms, or payment systems.\n\n2. Your approach: Describe how you'd build a dashboard that pulls status data from multiple disconnected platforms into a single view, with automated alerts when something needs attention. (Just a paragraph - we want to see how you think.)\n\n3. Availability: When could you start? How many hours/week can you commit?\n\n4. Rate: Your hourly rate and whether you're open to a retainer arrangement for ongoing work.\n\nNext Steps\nStrong candidates will have a brief intro call, sign an NDA, and then receive full details on our specific tech stack and workflow documentation before deciding if it's a mutual fit.\n\nQuestions?\nHappy to jump on a quick call to discuss the project in more detail.",

  "description": "Project Summary\n\nWe are completing an existing privacy-first, mobile-optimized web SaaS called SirenAiX — a discreet CRM and AI-powered messaging assistant designed for independent professionals and boutique agencies who handle high volumes of private client communication.\n\nThe core CRM, scheduling system, referral system, and UI already exist. However, the previous development team abandoned the project before completing the SMS, WhatsApp, and AI automation layers, which are the most critical components.\n\nWe are looking for an experienced engineer or small team to finish and harden the platform — not rebuild from scratch — with a strong focus on official messaging APIs, compliance, cost control, and long-term scalability.\n\nThis is an international product (not US-only) and must be built with privacy, discretion, and platform safety as first-class requirements.\n\n🔹 Project Description\nAbout SirenAiX\n\nSirenAiX is a web-based (no App Store), mobile-optimized SaaS that helps professionals and agencies manage:\n\nHigh volumes of inbound messages\n\nScheduling and availability across cities and countries\n\nClient follow-ups and re-engagement\n\nAutomation via AI so users are not glued to their phones\n\nThe AI acts like a sales and operations assistant — polite, caring, persuasive, and context-aware — while always allowing full human override.\n\nThe platform is intentionally neutral and flexible in terminology, allowing users to define their own roles (e.g. provider, therapist, companion, worker, model, etc.).\n\n🔹 What Is Already Built\n\nWeb-based CRM (clients, notes, tags, history)\n\nMobile-optimized dashboard UI\n\nScheduling & availability system\n\nBasic referral system\n\nAdmin foundation and user roles\n\nThese systems exist and work, but require enhancements and integration with messaging and AI.\n\n🔹 What Needs to Be Implemented / Completed\n1️⃣ SMS Messaging (Official, Compliant)\n\nTwo-way SMS via official providers only (Twilio or equivalent)\n\nInternational support (US, Canada, Europe, Australia, NZ, Asia)\n\nSupport users who already have existing phone numbers (no porting)\n\nWeb-based inbox for managing SMS conversations\n\nCost-aware architecture (avoid unnecessary per-message spend)\n\n2️⃣ WhatsApp Messaging (Zero-Ban Approach)\n\nUse official WhatsApp Business Platform only\n\nStrict opt-in, templates, rate limiting, and quality safeguards\n\nContent guardrails / sanitization to reduce policy risk\n\nWeb-based WhatsApp inbox\n\nClear separation between AI replies and human replies\n\n⚠️ Any suggestion involving unofficial libraries, emulation, or policy bypassing will be rejected.\n\n3️⃣ AI Messaging Assistant\n\nThe AI must:\n\nHandle inbound conversations like a sales assistant\n\nTrack:\n\nNew clients\n\nReturning clients\n\nPotential clients who could not be booked\n\nRemember preferences and conversation context\n\nAutomatically follow up when users return to a city/region\n\nWork in multiple languages (EN, ES, PT, FR, IT initially; roadmap for CN/JP)\n\nHuman vs AI Control (Critical)\n\nConversation modes:\n\nAI Auto\n\nHuman Only\n\nAI Draft (human approval)\n\nClear UI indicators\n\nManual override at all times\n\n4️⃣ Dynamic Rules & Logic\n\nConfigurable discount rules (e.g. early booking discounts)\n\nLocation-aware logic (city/state/region clarity)\n\nTime-zone aware scheduling\n\nMulti-number support for higher-tier users\n\n5️⃣ Referral System (Needs Expansion)\n\nRecurring residual commissions\n\nReferral dashboard (earnings, activity)\n\nTiered referral logic (future-ready)\n\nMarketing tools:\n\nAuto-generated banners\n\nShareable graphics\n\nQR codes\n\nNeutral copy\n\n6️⃣ Crypto-Only Subscription Payments\n\nPlatform subscriptions paid via crypto only\n\nBTC / USDT (XMR optional)\n\nNo custody of user funds\n\nNo personal names on invoices\n\nSubscription gating by tier\n\nGrace periods, retries, admin overrides\n\nClean, non-custodial confirmation flow\n\n7️⃣ Analytics & Metrics\n\nPrivacy-safe metrics such as:\n\nMessage volume\n\nResponse time\n\nLead-to-booking conversion\n\nPeak inquiry times\n\nLocation-based demand\n\n8️⃣ Feedback & Longevity\n\nIn-app suggestion box\n\nIssue reporting\n\nFeature requests\nThis is a long-term product, not a one-off build.\n\n🔹 Technical & Architectural Expectations\n\nMust work with an existing codebase\n\nClean separation of services (CRM, Messaging, AI)\n\nWeb-based inbox (no dependency on phone presence)\n\nQueue-based message handling\n\nCost-controlled messaging design\n\nInfrastructure suitable for privacy-conscious deployment\n\nNo App Store dependencies\n\n🔹 What We Need From Applicants (Required)\n\nTo be considered, please include:\n\nYour plan for implementing SMS + WhatsApp safely\n\nWhich WhatsApp route you recommend and why\n\nHow you’ll prevent AI from interfering with human conversations\n\nHow you’ll keep messaging costs under control\n\nExamples of production systems you’ve shipped involving messaging or AI\n\nConfirmation you can finish an abandoned project (not rebuild)",

The interviews are all 16:9 and so are the stills. There is quite a bit to pull the magic we need from.\n\nIncludes: pacing, music, simple motion graphics/titles, light sound polish\n\nBilingual interviews (Spanish/English) — you can either subtitle, or build around bilingual structure cleanly\nStyle target: Cinematic-doc energy (not corporate)\nEmotion + credibility (not melodrama)\nClear stakes, clear arc, clear “why now”\nNice-to-have (not required):\nPremiere or Resolve (either is fine)\nAfter Effects basics\nSubtitle workflow (SRT or burned-in)\n\nComfort experimenting with AI video tools for small inserts/transitions (only if it helps)\nWhat we’ll provide:\nFootage/interviews + background materials\nA rough narrative spine + key story beats (there’s real depth here — tragedy → vision → scale → impact) \nFast feedback and clear direction (we’re decisive)\n\nBudget + reality (read this before applying):\n$500 total for this week’s sizzle.\n\nWe’re early. This sizzle is to unlock funding.\nIf you crush this, you’re first in line for paid cutdowns and ongoing work once the raise funds.\nWho this is for:\nYou can cut fast without making it feel rushed\nYou know how to build a persuasive mini-story in 3-5 minutes\nYou care about nature / craft / legacy / beauty / ethical enterprise — at least enough to bring your full taste to it\nTimeline:\nStart immediately\n\nFirst cut in 48–72 hours\n\nFinal by end of week (we’re on a flight)\n\nTo apply:\nLink one sizzle/trailer/doc promo you edited (best one)\n\nConfirm: Can you deliver a strong first cut within 72 hours?\nTell me what you’d do in the first 30 minutes with our footage (your approach = your value)\nIf you’ve been waiting for a project with real soul and real stakes — this is it.",
